### Date created
This bikeshare project was initially created & submitted for grading on 17 Jul 2021 for the Introduction to Python course in Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree.  The bikeshare project was moved to gitHub on 21 Jul 2021 as part of my project for the Introduction to Version Control project for the same nanodegree program.  

### Project Title
Replace the Project Title

### Description
This program was built in Python using VSCode and GitBash to analyze a provided collection of data on bikesharing programs in three US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington D.C.  The goal was to build an interactive program which would allow the user to select a city of their choice, a filter of their choice (filter by a given month, day, or not at all), and to then return a series of automatically generated statistics about the dataset that the user defined.   After presenting these automated statistics, the program then offered the user an opportunity to page through the raw data, 5 lines at a time, if desired.  Finally, the program would prompt the user to either restart with a new query, or exit the program entirely.
